  "description": "MENTOR MIXER is a matching application that helps students or mentees find and match with a professional mentor or tutor. We created this application during our HOPE HACK 2020. MENTOR MIXER is meant to be used on desktops since a lot students have computers for school or work spaces. The whole point for MENTOR MIXER is to make it easier for students to find someone who wil be able to assist them own subjects they are having difficulty understanding. The application consists of our landing page which is a description for what our application is all about with a sign up button. From the landing page the user will go to the sign up page which will have them fill out a quick form of what they are looking for whether it be mentor or tutor or even both. Witin that form they will also be asked career interest, their mile radius to see how far they are willing to travel, and preffered language. From the sign-up the user will be redirected into their main content page which give them a match of mentors or tutors that the user will be able to select who they would like to have.",
